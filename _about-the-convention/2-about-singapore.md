### **About Singapore**

Singapore is a sunny, cosmopolitan city-state in South-east Asia, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. Comprising 63 islands at 721.5 square kilometres, its mainland is home to more than five million people of four major communities; Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian. Since its independence in 9 August 1965, the country has adopted a parliamentary democracy system. The government and the cabinet are helmed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong while President Halimah Yacob is Singapore’s President.

Ideally positioned in South-east Asia, just a hop, skip and jump away from the rest of the region, Singapore is a thriving metropolis offering a fully integrated island-wide transport network, world-class infrastructure, dynamic business environment and vibrant living spaces. Singapore’s rich and unique culture draws from its variety of ethnic communities, each offering different perspectives of life in Singapore in terms of culture, religion, food, language and history.

Singapore is ranked fourth globally according to the 2018 Global Financial Centres Index (GCFI) survey, positioned as a regional gateway for Renminbi (RMB) with liquid capital markets. Its strategic location also makes it the preferred choice for businesses.

From art and cultural exchanges, to the creation of cutting-edge innovation which enrich the lives of the communities at home and abroad, to the coming together of world-class minds to spark new business opportunities locally and internationally, Singapore is simply, the place where worlds meet. 


### **Singapore’s Legal Industry**

The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) is responsible for developing Singapore as an international legal services hub, and works with the public and private sectors to do so. 

Singapore is today home to top international law practices, while Singapore law practices are among the largest in the region, with strong regional expertise. It has developed strong capabilities across a wide range of practice areas such as debt restructuring and dispute resolution. 

As an international dispute resolution hub, Singapore has built up a strong ecosystem to support the hearing of disputes in Singapore:
*	Arbitral awards, court judgments and mediated settlement agreements in Singapore have the advantage of enforceability, as Singapore has ratified the New York Convention on the Cross-Border Enforceability of Arbitral Awards, the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements; while its Mediation Act provides for mediated settlement agreements to be recorded and enforced as court orders. 
*	Singapore has introduced sound and progressive legislation for dispute resolution, including a framework for third-party funding in international commercial arbitration. 
*	Singapore is today recognised as the 3rd most preferred seat of arbitration globally.
*	Singapore has a full suite of dispute resolution institutions to meet the needs of users. These include the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), which is the 3rd most preferred arbitral institution around the world; the Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC), and the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC). 
*	Purpose-built hearing facilities are available at Maxwell Chambers, the world’s first integrated dispute resolution complex. 

The Singapore Government has also launched various programmes such as the public sector transformation and initiatives to promote a conducive environment for innovation and encourage the development of legal tech and other advancements in law.
