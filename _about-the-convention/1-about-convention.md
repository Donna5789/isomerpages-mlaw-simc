### **Introduction** 

On 20 December 2018, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), passed a resolution to adopt the United Nations (UN) Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation, and to name it after Singapore.

The ### **Singapore Convention on Mediation** is the first treaty under the auspices of the UN to be named after Singapore. The signing ceremony for the Convention will be held in Singapore on 7 August 2019.

### **What is the Singapore Convention on Mediation?**

The Singapore Convention on Mediation addresses the lack of an effective means to enforce cross-border mediated settlement agreements.

The Courts of contracting parties to the Convention can readily enforce the agreements and also invoke the Convention as a defence against a claim.

This will give businesses greater assurance that mediated settlement agreements can be relied upon to resolve cross-border commercial disputes, facilitating the growth of international commerce and promotes the use of mediation around the world.

### **Key Features**

The Convention will apply to international commercial settlement agreements resulting from mediation. 

•	It will not apply to international settlement agreements concluded in the course of judicial or arbitral proceedings which are enforceable as a court judgment or arbitral award.
•	It will also not apply to settlement agreements concluded for personal, family or household purposes by one of the parties (a consumer), as well as settlement agreements relating to family, inheritance or employment law.

The courts of a contracting party will be expected to handle applications either
(a)	To enforce an international settlement agreement which falls within the scope of the Convention 
or 
(b)	To allow a party to invoke the settlement agreement in order to prove that the matter has already been resolved, in accordance with its rules of procedure, and under the conditions laid down in the Convention.
The courts of a contracting party may refuse to grant relief on the grounds laid down in the Convention, including:

•	If a party to the settlement agreement was under incapacity;
•	If the settlement agreement is not binding, null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed under the law which it is subjected to;
•	If there was a serious breach by the conciliator of standards applicable to the conciliator, without which breach that party would not have entered into the settlement agreement;
•	If granting relief would be contrary to the public policy of the contracting party.

### **Why Singapore?**

Singapore played an important role in in bringing about the Convention as the chair of The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Working Group II (WGII). The UNICITRAL WGII on Dispute Settlement has been working on instruments to provide for the cross-border enforcement of international commercial settlement agreements reached through mediation. 

The Singapore delegation’s role as chair included handling of cross-border telecommunications with foreign delegations to assess international concerns, resolving of disputes, finalising the text and managing the divergent views of all the delegations. After three years of debate, the hard work finally cumulated in the Convention. 

The Ministry of Law team and other government agencies also worked alongside stakeholders and the UN, and Singapore’s effort in the entire process was recognised by the unanimous support of the UN for Singapore to host the signing of this convention and for the convention to be named the Singapore Convention of Mediation.
