### **Why Singapore?** 

Singapore played an important role in in bringing about the Convention as the chair of The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Working Group II
(WGII). The UNICITRAL WGII on Dispute Settlement has been working on instruments to provide for the cross-border enforcement of international commercial settlement
agreements reached through mediation.

The Singapore delegation’s role as chair included handling of cross-border telecommunications with foreign delegations to assess international concerns, resolving of disputes, finalising the text and managing the divergent views of all the delegations. After
three years of debate, the hard work finally cumulated in the Convention.

The Ministry of Law team and other government agencies also worked alongside stakeholders and the UN, and Singapore’s effort in the entire process was recognised by the
unanimous support of the UN for Singapore to host the signing of this convention and forthe convention to be named the Singapore Convention of Mediation.
